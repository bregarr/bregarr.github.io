            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a first-year student at Michigan State University, specifically at the College of Communication Arts and Sciences. I am on track to graduate in May 2027 with a Bachelor of Arts in Games and Interactive Media with minors in Computer Science and Games and Interactive Media. I am a very passionate developer with experience with Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, and C++ in descending confidence order.</p>

            <p>In my free time, I like to play video games of many genres, but most often I play Minecraft, American Truck Simulator, and Rainbow Six Siege</p>

            <p>During my tenure in high school, I was trained on a CNC mill, a lathe, a laser engraver, and 3D printers. I also received my CCNAv7 certification and was trained on basic network security and cybersecurity.</p>
