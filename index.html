        <p id="FeedText">I have officially obtained a domain for this site! texascod.in now directs users to this page. I'm not sure the redirect is up quite yet, but I'm marking this down now as opposed to checking over the course of the next few hours. I've also built out some more pages, but the projects page isn't quite ready yet. Here's to the beginning of my portfolio!</p>

        <p id="FeedText">While the website is still offline as of typing this post, it is nice to have *something* to put here to test my code and styles before everything is officially public. My domain purchase is still pending but I am really excited about what I got (and even more suprised about the deal I got!). Hopefully I'll look back at this post and cringe about my hard-coding of this section, but for now this'll do.</p>
